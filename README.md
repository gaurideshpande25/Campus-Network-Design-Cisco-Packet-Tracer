# Campus Network Design & Wireless Segmentation
*Tool Used:* Cisco Packet Tracer 8.2

## Project Overview
This project simulates a university campus network connecting multiple buildings: Male/Female Hostels, a Library, and an Administrative Office. It demonstrates the ability to manage wireless zones, configure inter-building connectivity, and deploy network services (DNS/HTTP).

## Key Features Implemented
* *Wireless Zoning:* Configured distinct Access Points for 4 separate zones (Male Hostel, Female Hostel, Library, Office) to manage user traffic.
* *Server Integration:* Deployed HTTP and DNS servers (10.0.0.2, 10.0.0.3) to simulate internal web hosting and domain resolution.
* *Network Topology:* Star topology connecting multiple buildings via a central distribution switch (Switch0).
* *Connectivity Verification:* Successful ICMP (Ping) connectivity established between all end devices and servers (as seen in the "Last Status" log).
